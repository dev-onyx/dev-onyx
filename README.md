### about
i build systems that merge intelligence, interaction, and design.  
my work explores how computation can think — how interfaces can adapt — and how code can feel intentional.  
specialized in **next.js**, **node.js**, and **python**, with emphasis on scalable architectures and ai-native workflows.
